This is the template for assignment 1 of UCLA CS 174A, taught by professor
Demetri Terzoupolos.

The Angel folder contain the necessary math functions such as vector and matrix 
types and functions. The Ball* files are for mouse arcball control. The FrameSaver
files are for recording into frames, which will be used later in second project
for movie generation. the glsl files are shaders, for now, you do not need to understand
them. The majority(maybe all) of your coding should happen within anim.cpp.

The first step is to successfully run this template code. Second step is to study
the display function inside anim.cpp and try to play with it by adding now objects.
